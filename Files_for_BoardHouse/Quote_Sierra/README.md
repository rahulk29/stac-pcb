We received two quotes from Sierra:
Q1594905-1.doc, which is for 5 day turnaround with blue soldermask.
Q1594905-2.doc, which is for 10 day turnaround with green soldermask.

Switching to green + 10 days saves over $1,000.

To use an LPI soldermask process, the min pad to pad clearance / soldermask sliver is:
* 8 mils pad to pad (1.5 mil clearance min and 5 mil min web) if the color is not green
* 1.5 mil clearance and 4 mil min web so 7 mils if the color is green

If we are below these thresholds, the soldermask process gets bumped up to LDI-LPI.
Non-green soldermask is expensive because STAC/PROPEL's min soldermask sliver is 7.7 mils,
which requires LDI-LPI. Sierra also seems to charge more for colors other than green, even if
the soldermask process were to be LPI.
