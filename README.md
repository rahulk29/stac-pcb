# STAC PCB

This repo contains the PCB for the SRAM Timing Analysis Chip (STAC).

See the [STAC repo](https://github.com/ucb-bar/stac-top) for more information on STAC.
In short: the STAC chip contains several test SRAM instances generated by SRAM22,
along with circuitry for measuring SRAM correctness and access time.

This board is still a work-in-progress; it is not yet complete.
