# STAC PCB

This repo contains the PCB for the SRAM Timing Analysis Chip (STAC).

See the [STAC repo](https://github.com/ucb-bar/stac-top) for more information on STAC.
In short: the STAC chip contains several test SRAM instances generated by SRAM22,
along with circuitry for measuring SRAM correctness and access time.

Also see the [STAC test plan](https://github.com/ucb-bar/stac-top/blob/stac-master/docs/test_plan.md).
