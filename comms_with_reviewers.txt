Hi Felicia, 

Thanks for agreeing to check my files/repo for my upcoming TestpPlan/Schematic  review.  I included a list of files with this email:
1. Test Plan doc - goal and design intent
2. Schematic PDF of the altium schematics
3. Board Physical Plan doc -  board physical constraints (stackup, SMAs, etc)
4. Bill of Materials
5. Gantt chart for project management

The native files are also pushed to the pcb repo: https://bwrcrepo.eecs.berkeley.edu/pcb/stac-pcb

Best,
    Rahul

Hi Bozhi, Yahia, Felicia,

Thank you for agreeing to be reviewers for my PCB TestPlan/Schematic review.  Felicia Guo in my group has done a first-pass check to confirm that the documentation set is in order.  
I've scheduled our review for Tuesday at 3pm.

The schematic documents for review are attached. They can also be found at:
https://bwrcrepo.eecs.berkeley.edu/pcb/stac-pcb/-/tree/main/v1-pcb

You are all invited to attend my PCB schematic review for STAC, the SRAM Timing Analysis Chip. The review is scheduled for Monday, 10/30/2023, at 2:30pm.

 STAC is a fully digital Skywater 130nm chip designed for testing custom SRAM macros Rohan and I designed.

The following documents can be found here:
1. Test Plan doc - goal and design intent
2. Schematic PDF of the altium schematics
3. Board Physical Plan doc -  board physical constraints (stackup, SMAs, etc)
4. Bill of Materials
5. Gantt chart for project management

1.  231027_test_plan.md
2.  231027_schematics.pdf
3.  231027_Board_Physical_Plan_stac_pcb.pptx
4.  231027_bom.pdf
5.  231027_gantt.pdf

Copies are also attached to this email. Felicia has briefly checked over these.

If you can't make it, please let me know. I think we have a good number of reviewers, but if more than a few people need a different time, we can reschedule.

Thanks!

Best,
Rahul
