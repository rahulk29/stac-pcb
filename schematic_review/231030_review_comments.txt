ldo should be tunable to 0.4V, need 10mV resolution
add pin for source meters - learning module O or N (Bob wrote it)
need to find a source meter – ask bob or scum people (bench 14)
keysight supplies not precise enough? look at bench 14 keysight supply model number. look in manual to see what resolution you can set. then look at bob's bench, see what resolution his supply supports.


options for power sweeping:
add connector for source meter. change 3 pin jumper selector header to 4 pin so we can have ground. label gnd on silkscreen.
use manually trimmed pot

next board: use i2c controlled pot on next board

reset button momentary switch
custom_boot SPDT switch – can use a DIP switch 3x2, debounced
switch for all clocksel bits – can use a DIP switch 3x2, debounced

use PMODs A B and D for SE signals
PMOD B:
SRAM_SCAN_MODE

ask bora:
with arty connected to stac pcb, both initially off, is it ok to power on arty first?
concerned that current will be drawn through gpio clamps on the stac chip.

add 0603 zero ohm resistor so that it's possible to disconnect clock_clock from FPGA's PMOD connector
this is in case we increase the signal amplitude on clock_clock... don't want over/under voltage going to the FPGA

check jtag header pin mapping
can use custom one made by yufeng (it is a jtag+uart board)
add photo of this to board physical plan

reset is active low (should be called resetb)

layout:
start with Felicia's layer stackup (Design > Layer Stack Manager)
if stac board is ready at same time as Felicia's can go on the same panel
